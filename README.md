# Air-Quality-Index-using-Power-BI

# Introduction
Welcome to the Air Quality Analysis project! This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the air quality using Power BI . The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the air pollution levels in India , identify trends, and derive insights that can be used for making data-driven decisions to improve air quality.

# Key Features
ðŸ“Œ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis: Monitor and evaluate the air quality index over time, identifying patterns and trends.

ðŸ“Œ Pollutant Concentration Tracking: Measure and analyze the levels of key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3.

ðŸ“Œ Geographical Mapping: Visualize air quality data across different regions of India, pinpointing areas with critical pollution levels.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazRxMF93VkhMWDJHNzhJeVdmTVZTZTg2N0xid3xBQ3Jtc0trQS1zaWdXSHFkN1hqOHFEYWtTeEtQMTh3cFJCUXI4SnlJdVA3ZDIxUXZFLW9Qd0x2bEo2QkJCd3ZyYXI5RXBiWS0tak9DQkRGMDJMczF1cVEtYURpZ21OYU01VmJuTUpuZGhHNnVDUllqRFc0V0d4MA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1Kx_62pOr3H2GkvrOnGRBG95H2rlLX8Me%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing&v=c3a7QDNi1R4 
and includes information on various air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 from multiple monitoring stations across Beijing over several years.

# Key features of the dataset:

Date and time of the measurements
Concentrations of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)
Meteorological data (temperature, pressure, dew point, wind speed, etc.)

# Key Insights
Air Quality Trends: Observe how air quality has changed over months and years, identifying periods of significant improvement or decline.
Pollutant Sources: Determine the primary sources of various pollutants, aiding in targeted mitigation strategies.
Impact of Policies: Assess the effectiveness of environmental policies and regulations on improving air quality.
Health Implications: Understand the potential health risks associated with varying levels of air pollution.

# Analysis
The analysis focuses on the following key areas:

Trend Analysis: Identifying trends in air pollution over time.
Variations across Cities : Understanding how air quality varies with Cities.

# Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the air quality data. It includes multiple pages with detailed visualizations and filters to allow users to dive deep into specific aspects of the data.

# Technologies Used
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
